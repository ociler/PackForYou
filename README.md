This is the project I've developed as my Final Degree Project on the Universitat Politècnica de València for the degree of Computer Engineering. You can find the thesis here: https://riunet.upv.es/handle/10251/187349.

<b> Abstract: </b>

PackForYou is an Android app made to help delivery men to do his job in a faster and better way. With this app, he will be able to manage his packages (create, read, update or delete them), visualize them in a map and sort them using different algorithms: Directions API, Brute Force, Nearest Neoghbour and Urgency. Taking into account all these operations, the route drawn on the map will change automatically. The delivery man will also be able to access to a preview mode, letting him follow the route in advance. And all this with a very good-looking and intuitive User interface.

<b>Future work:</b>

- Delivery Men won't have to call their clients to know if they will be at home or not. Instead of it, they will know it via this app, as this client will receive a Telegram message where he will be able to say if he will be at home or not and, i not, he will be able to send another location.

- Automated testing.
